- when 2 portals are clicked
    - check if they are the same
    - check if they are already connected
    - check connection limit of portals
    - calc the len of link
    - check if the start portal is under field
        - if yes, assert len of link <= 500m
    - check if the new link cross existing links
    - add link to links
    - get left/right larget field, add fields
        - search for new closed loop
        - determine the orientation(left/right) of the new field
        - for each orientation, choose the one with larger area
    - update portals, stats, logs
